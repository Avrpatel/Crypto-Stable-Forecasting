# Project-2
Northwestern Bootcamp Project 2 - Evan Sadasivan, Avinash Patel and Christine Nashihibi

Notes:
Revisit the crypto and stable coin data that we analyzed in the first project. We will add some additional midcap and small cap cryptos to our analysis. We will use SKLearn and Keras or TensorFlow to make a predictive model. Using data through the recent Terra/Luna Crash to make predictions about the future of crypto.

Hypothesis: Despite the recent downward trend in crypto/stable coins within the previous six months, they continue to be a great digital currency and investment. We will use our predictive model to determine the next several months and beyond.

Possible addition: We then use NLP to examine how people have responded to crypto and how we predict they will respond.
